The Monk is a powerful hand to hand combatant with an array of abilities to disable or damage enemies.  However, Monks are strictly limited in the equipment they can wear, which can make them vulnerable on the front lines.

Monks have skill with basic weapons, however they generally will prefer to fight unarmed.  They have a stronger unarmed strike than normal members of their race, and it increases in power as the Monk gains levels.  Monks are strictly prohibited from wearing armor and cannot gain proficiency in the use of any armor.

<span style="font-family: blue;">Strength</span> is the most important ability score for most Monks, as it controls their ability to hit and do damage in melee.  <span style="float: left; width:auto; font-family: blue;">Constitution</span> is also important for improving the Monk's ability to soak up damage they will take while in melee combat.
