Druids need a high primary spell casting attribute (<span style="float: left; width:auto; font-family: blue;">Intelligence</span> for Mages, <span style="float: left; width:auto; font-family: blue;">Wisdom</span> for Priests, or <span style="float: left; width:auto; font-family: blue;">Charisma</span> for Adepts).  <span style="float: left; width:auto; font-family: blue;">Dexterity</span> is also important for increasing the Druid's modest Armor Class and improving attack rolls with ranged weapons.
