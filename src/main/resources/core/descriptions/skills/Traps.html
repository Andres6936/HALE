The Traps skill allows you to create, place, disarm, recover, and bypass a variety of mechanical traps.  A higher skill level allows you to work with more complex traps.  Recovering traps is usually more difficult than simply disarming them.  Only <span style="font-family: red;">Rogues</span> can use the Traps skill.
