Enchanting is the art of imbuing an existing item with the magical properties of various components using appropriate recipes.  A higher Enchantment skill gives you access to more complex and powerful recipes.  Only <span style="font-family: red;">Mages</span> are able to enchant items.  Recipes are unlocked based on your base skill level not including any bonuses.
