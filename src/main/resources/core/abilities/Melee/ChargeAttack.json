  "description" : "You select a target that must be at least 3 hexes and no more than 8 hexes away, and charge at them, following the charge with a powerful attack.  The attack is made with a +40 attack bonus and a +100 damage bonus, and costs only as much as a standard attack - there is no AP cost for the movement.  The charge can only be performed in a straight line path, and you must have sufficient AP to perform the attack.  You must have a melee weapon equipped to use this ability.  If the charge is interrupted for any reason (such as an attack of opportunity or stepping on a trap), the attack is not completed.",
