  "description" : "Glacial Wave upgrades your Freeze spell.  A wave of magical cold radiates rapidly out from the caster with a radius of 5 hexes, sucking all heat out of the area.  Creatures within the area must succeed at a physical resistance check or be frozen solid (paralyzed) for 2 to 4 rounds.  Even if the check is succesful, each creature suffers an Action Point penalty of 15 plus the caster level as well as taking 6 to 12 plus one per caster level cold damage.  Creatures friendly to the caster take only half damage and do not suffer the other negative effects.",
