<div>
The appearance of the hostile creature has caused the game to enter combat mode.  You can see the <span style="font-family: red">Combat Order Ticker</span> on the left side of the screen, indicating that your turn is first, followed by the Orc.
</div>

<div style="margin-top: 1em;">
Combat moves forward with each creature taking turns one at a time, in the order shown.  Creatures have 100 <span style="font-family: red">Action Points</span> each turn.  Moving, attacking, and most other actions you can take consume action points.

<div style="margin-top: 1em;">
Now, attack the Orc by left clicking on it or right clicking and selecting "Attack".
