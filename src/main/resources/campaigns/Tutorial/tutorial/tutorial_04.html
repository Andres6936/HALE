Taking an item
</div>

<div>
Good job!  You'll notice that when you opened the chest, a window popped up showing the contents of the chest.  You are going to want to use the club contained inside.
</div>

<div style="margin-top: 1em;">
To do this, you need to take the club from the chest, then equip it.  So, close this window, then right click on the club and select "Take", or simply click the "Take All" button on the container window.  Alternatively, you can click and drag on the club and drop it on your character's portrait in the upper right hand part of the screen.
