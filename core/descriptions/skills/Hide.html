The Hide skill allows you to move unseen and unheard by others.  This is useful for scouting areas or getting the drop on hostile creatures.  Your Hide checks are opposed by Search checks of any creatures you are trying to Hide from.  Only <span style="font-family: red;">Rogues</span> have access to the Hide skill.  Note that heavier armor applies a substantial penalty to your Hide skill.
