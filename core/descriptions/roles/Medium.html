A Medium is a spellcaster using an intuitive form of magic that comes naturally to them.  Rather than casting specific spells from the different schools of magic, Mediums combine words and gestures to produce whatever effect the current situation warrants.  However, these effects are not as refined as true spells, and take longer to create.

Like the Mage, the Medium is at a disadvantage in melee combat, with a limited pool of hit points and very limited training in weapons and armor.
