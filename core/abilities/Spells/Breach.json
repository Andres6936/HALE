Up to one point per caster level of spell resistance on that creature is negated for 5 to 10 rounds.  In addition, up to two of the following defensive spells are removed from the target or its armor: Harden Armor, Absorb Energy, Deflect Projectiles, Chameleon, Layer of Bark, Shield, Fortify Health, Ward, Energy Immunity, or Invulnerability.  If the target has more than two of these defensive spells active, two are chosen randomly.  Note that unlike other targeted spells, this spell ignores the target's concealment.",
