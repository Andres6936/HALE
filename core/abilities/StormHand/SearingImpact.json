On each successful attack, your opponent must succeed at a Physical Resistance check or suffer 1 point of Constitution damage for 5 rounds.  The difficulty of the check depends on your Storm Hand level and Wisdom.  This ability stacks, so further attacks can continue to accumulate more Constitution damage.",
