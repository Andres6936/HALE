  "description" : "The Bardsong is the basic ability of all Bard characters.  As you progress in levels, you learn a variety of songs that can be activated through this ability.  Only one bardsong may be active at any given time.  While playing a bardsong, Bards suffer a 50 point Action Penalty due to the concentration involved in the song.  Bard songs typically affect all creatures within an 8 hex radius of the Bard.  Some songs affect only friendly creatures, while some affect only hostiles.",
