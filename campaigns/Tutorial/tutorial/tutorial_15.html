Good job.  You now have enough HP to fight the Orcs.

Lets try using a basic Offensive Ability.  First, press "End Turn" and allow one of the Orcs to close with you.  When your turn comes up again, click on the quickbar icon of a fist near the bottom of the screen.  This selects your "Mighty Blow" ability.  Then click on the Orc to activate the ability.
