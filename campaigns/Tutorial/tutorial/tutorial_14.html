You have just triggered a trap.  Your Warrior has little defense against Traps.  The Rogue role, however, can find, disarm, and even place traps.
</div>

<div style="margin-top: 1em;">
The trap did significant damage to your character's Hit Points (HP).  In addition, you have just spotted some hostile Orcs, putting you in a bad spot!

Luckily, a potion of healing has been added to your inventory.  Open your inventory, right click on the potion to open the menu, and select "Drink" to drink the potion.
