The Quickbar

Good work!  You can also equip and use items via the quickbar.  Try opening up your inventory and dragging some items to the quickbar.  Then, try opening your character sheet (the heart shaped icon near your inventory) and taking a look at your Abilities tab.  All items and abilities have a "View Details" window.  You can even drag items for both of your hands (such as a sword and shield) to one slot.

Once you are done experimenting, go ahead and dispatch the remaining opponents.  You will note that your "Mighty Blow" ability has a cooldown, preventing you from using it again immediately.
